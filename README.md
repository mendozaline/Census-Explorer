# Census Explorer
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app allows you to map data from the U.S. Census Bureau's [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) using React and D3.js.

It's still a work in progress...
