# Census Explorer

March 15, 2017

Final project for Hack Oregon [React JS](https://badgr.io/public/assertions/T6WSRf6fSD6Iws58o1Q_rw) class.

DEMO: [https://mendozaline.github.io/Census-Explorer/](https://mendozaline.github.io/Census-Explorer/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app allows you to map data from the U.S. Census Bureau's [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) using React and D3.js.

It's still a work in progress...
